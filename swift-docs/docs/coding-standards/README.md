# Installation Manual

## Customer Application

The customer application is built with Vue.js using Vuetify's UI components. The application is a PWA (Progressive Web Application) which uses the Capacitor framework to turn the web app into a native app that can run one app across Android, IOS, Electron, and the Web with the same code base.


* **How to install and run the customer application locally:**
``` sh
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/COS301-SE-2020/Swift.git

# Navigate to the app directory
cd *./swift-app

# install all the project dependencies
npm install

# install vue cli
npm install -g @vue/cli

# run the application
npm run serve (open up browser at http://localhost:8080/)
```
