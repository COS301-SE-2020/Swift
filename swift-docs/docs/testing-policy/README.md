# Testing Policy

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Availability, Scalability and Performance Testing

The customer application is built with Vue.js using Vuetify's UI components. The application is a PWA (Progressive Web Application) which uses the Capacitor framework to turn the web app into a native app that can run one app across Android, IOS, Electron, and the Web with the same code base.


### Usability and Availability Testing
The management application uses the same technology stack as the customer application and includes the Vuesax UI library to build the UI components
