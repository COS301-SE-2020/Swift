# Introduction

## Purpose of Swift
Swift aims to create a convenient, flexible, and scalable interface suitable for both customers and restaurants giving users the opportunity to order, track and pay for their food immediately. The application will also use Augmented Reality to show real live photogrammetry models of the food, making the menu come to life.

## Scope
This system will aim improve the customer experience at a restaurant by enabling clients to order any item from the menu at their convenience. Customers will be able to add notes (e.g.food allergies) on how they would like the food to be prepared. The app will further allow theclients to view a 3D Augmented Reality model of the food item, as well as pay for the food through the application.

There will also be a system for the management and waiters which they will use to view customer orders, check if the customers need any assistance or update the progress of the customerâ€™s food or drinks order. There will be a table layout screen where the waiters will view all the orders for a table or the status of the customer e.g. if a customer has not been attended to yet.  When a client is seated, they will check in to the application which will activate one of the tables and will monitor their status e.g. if the customer has arrived 5 minutes ago but has not been served yet, a notification will be sent to the waiters. 

## Business need
The software system must perform smoothly and accurately in real time, in a bid to attract  a substantial number of both restaurants and customers to employ the system. The design of the system must strive to be user friendly, clean, and easy to use to ensure a minimal learning curve. Restaurants will have the opportunity to better market their business using AR technology to map the food items as well as updates on current specials.

## Overview
Swift aims to create a convenient, flexible, and scalable interface suitable for both customers and restaurants.  Customers will have the opportunity to order, track and pay for their food immediately. The experience will be akin to ordering food from an application such as UberEats, with the contrast that it will be an in-restaurant experience. The application will also use Augmented Reality to show real live photogrammetry models of the food, making the menu come to life. Swift will aim to accelerate the speed of execution and simplify the food ordering process of restaurants resulting in minimum delays and confusion.
